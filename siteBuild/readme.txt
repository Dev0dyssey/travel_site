Hello! 

Some further details on our small project below. There is no correct or incorrect way of achieving this design, so use whichever method you find comfortable. You can also take this design as far as you want functionality wise (front end only and time permitting of course!) and feel free to include any plugins you see fit to achieve that. 

There are some links to the required fonts and style guide below. The style guide should have all the information you need for all aspects of the design. 

Fonts -

League Spartan - https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/league-spartan

Poppins - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins

We’ve also included less.js to allow you to work with that locally should you need to. Applying styling to the styles.less file within the styles folder if you wish to use Less. Be aware though due to a known issue it won’t work in chrome, so use another preferred browser if going down this route! If you are to not use LessCSS you can add standard CSS to the siteStyle.css file within the styles folder

Need any further documentation on less.js you can find it here: http://lesscss.org/

Once you have completed the exercise could you submit your work via https://wetransfer.com/ - uploading a zip folder for your project creation. This will be reviewed and we shall provide feedback. Please send this to linda@newmind.co.uk

Many thanks and Good Luck!
